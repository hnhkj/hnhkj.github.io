## Introduction

Huang Kongjun. a engineer. 15+ years experience in Embedded Hardware &Firmware Development. I can skill hardware design  and firmware design. can write C/c++ program, linux shell, VHDL program etc, and can wirte/modify wince driver, linux driver modify and compile and wirte windows/linux application. now I am study html+css+javascript, node.js, lua etc knowledge. It for a new project Ethernet MOHPlayer.

## Working

I'm mainly work are new product designed and production technical support. Main skill is hardware design, firmware desing, and pc test code via C embedded product too. I can draw a 3D drawing for product design. I can build the Wince OS and Linux OS for embedded and modify some driver code and write some test application. maybe still an amateur. I'm trying to make skilled.

#### Chip used

Micro controllers : 8051,PIC16Fxx, STM8S003, STM32F103, LPC2368, LPC1768, esp8266(wifi mcu), mt7688(router ic), AM335x, etc.

CPLD/FPGA: EMP240 CPLD, A3P400 FPGA etc. 

Kit software: Protel, KEIL, IAR systems, vs2010, version control(git,svn), solidwork(3D), 2bizbox(erp),etc.

#### Involved projects

I'm involved in many project. CCTV, Caravan Alarm, SD Recorder, MultiCorder, IPTap, CallCaddy Digital, Lead, phmg player, Clover 5.8G etc.

The latest project wifi moh player. core ic use mt7688.running openwrt linux os. this project need to understand many new language. openwrt. linux. uci. shell. htnl. css. javascrip. jQuery. node.js lua. python. etc. it is a new area.

I think this ic can improve many product. pbx recorder. ip phone recorder. isdn recorder etc. 

## project brief

#### Caravan Alarm

global tech's project. Project include IR detect, g-sensor, rf-key etc. it use Microchip PIC16F serial MCU.

#### SD Recorder

a alone telephone Recorder, It can recorder Analog telephone commnication and save sound to SD card. It use LPC2368 serial MCU. It include a simple LCD128x64 and some key


#### IPTAP - 2014

a IP phone recorder project. It include two 10/100M port and a usb port. PC software can get and save ip phone communcation. 
device get 10/100M ethernet cabel signal and send to PC via usb.

#### MultiCorder

a project for ISDN PRI & BRI recorder.


#### PHMG MOH Player - 2015

a MOH Player. for PBX music player. It's a music player. include a TF card, a USB stick interface, internal a spi-flash(save 16MByte music file). player music to PBX.

#### Ethernet MOHPlayer - 2016

a wifi router IC MT7688. It run linux OS.


#### IPTap3 - 2017

a Gigabit ethernet IP Phone Recorder project. old IPTap only use in 10/100M. This project is a Gigabit project. It's used to Gigabit ethernet. So, It's used all of IPPhone. It's running a linux os. get IPPhone and send to PC via ethernet.

#### Insight Electirc - 2017

This project is sample device. It sample CAR's data and transmit to Etherent. It include GNSS, 4G LTE, G-Sensor, CAN 2.0, RS232, RS485 etc interface. It's running a linux and a PIC MCU firmware. This is a new project. Hardware design completed.
